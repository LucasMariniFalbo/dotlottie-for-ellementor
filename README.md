# dotLottie for Elementor
A basic and fast made widget for elementor that supports the brand new .lottie extension

# About updates
1. I haven't upload this widget to Wordpress database because Elementor dev team should be depploying a update to suport .lottie extension
eventually. So this widget should be temporary.

2. Even without git track, I'll be updating this plugin as long Elementor don't release a .lottie support and requests might show.

3. To download and check for updates, go to https://brasa-digital.com/apps/dotlottie-for-elementor/ or the github repository https://github.com/LucasMariniFalbo/dotlottie-for-ellementor
