# dotLottie for Elementor
A basic and fast made widget for elementor that supports the brand new .lottie extension 

## About updates
1. I haven't upload this widget to Wordpress database because Elementor dev team should be depploying a update to suporte .lottie extension
soon enough. So this widget is temporary for sure. 
2. That doens't mean i'll be updating the plugin as long Elementor don't release a .lottie suport. So, in order to check for updates; request a new one or contribute to the code, visit https://brasa-digital.com/dotlottie-elementor
