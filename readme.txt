= Is dotLottie for Elementor compatible with the latest version of Elementor? =

Yes, is tested up to the last version. Also, is a very simple plugin that basically adds a new widget to Elementor, so new wordpress updates shouldn't bring issues.

= Are there any performance concerns with dotLottie for Elementor? =

Not at all, the widget scripts will only be loaded by the users if you use the dotLottie widget on your pages. The script itself is about the same size as the base lottie script, but the fact that you now can use .lottie files instead of heavy .json files, makes everything lighter. This widget inscreases your site performance compared to lottie standart widget.
